# 01 - Setup Azure Subscription

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in.
2. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create one:
   - Free trial: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
   - Or create a paid subscription and be careful to delete resources after the lab.
3. Make note of your Subscription ID for documentation screenshots.

Tips:
- Use tags or a dedicated resource group for all lab resources so cleanup is easier.
